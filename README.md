04/13/2016 — Theme initial creation

* due to people having trouble with some of the tutorials used to create this theme. Decided to throw it together and package them up for a simple theme install.
* due to people requesting how to have the side padding sorta similar to the community forums as well this is the reason for this theme.

To Do:
* clean up any minor styling issues
* keep improving further as my time allows
* fix a few issues I haven't gotten to yet
